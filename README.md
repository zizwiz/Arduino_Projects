# Arduino Projects
[![Open Source Love](https://badges.frapsoft.com/os/v1/open-source.svg?v=103)](https://github.com/ellerbrock/open-source-badges/)

This is a set of small projects I have worked on using Arduinos and C# winform apps. Each project is in a separate folder. Each folder will have a Readme document to explain what I have done. There may be some projects that have not been finished and polished but there will be enough to get it working. 

Please note that where I have used code written by someone else I have acknowledged them but in some instances I may have unintentionally missed an acknowledgement. If you see one any I have missed please let me know so I can correct it.
